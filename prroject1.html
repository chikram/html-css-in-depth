                <h2>Pure HALAL Beef</h2>
                <p>Little Lemon meat patties are produced from 100% pure halal beef with no additives, preservatives or
                    flavour enhancers. The beef patties are prepared and packaged at Little Lemon approved meat plants.
                    In
                    addition to inspections carried out before the beef arrives at the plants, our suppliers undertake
                    several separate quality checks on every batch. All our beef is grilled to perfection, without the
                    addition of fats or oils, on a double sided hotplate, and we make sure that the specified
                    temperature is maintained during the whole beef-grilling process to ensure safety while guaranteeing
                    juicy tasty patties.</p>

                <h2>HALAL Farm-FRESH Chicken</h2>
                <p>All our chicken sandwiches and McNuggets are made from manually deboned chicken breast meat. No
                    additives or preservatives are added during any stage of preparation.</p>

                <h2>Potatoes</h2>
                <p>Our fries are crispy and far from the ordinary. The secret lies in the harvesting of high quality
                    potatoes that come from trusted suppliers. The potatoes are then cooked using only 100% vegetable
                    oil with no fats or flavours, and only some salt is added after cooking.</p>
